Graduating with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) in May 2023 marks a significant milestone in my life and career. This achievement is not just a testament to my academic abilities but also a reflection of my dedication to the field of computer science. The journey through my coursework, including Data Structures & Algorithms, Software Quality Assurance, Project Management, Calculus, Discrete Mathematics, Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Ethics & Communications, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning, has been both challenging and exhilarating.

## Projects That Shaped My Experience

### Bee/Wasp Machine Learning Analysis

One of my proudest achievements during my studies was my capstone project, where I created a [user-friendly Google Colab Notebook for analyzing photos of bees or wasps](/portfolio/bee-wasp-ai-ml-web-app/). This project allowed me to harness Python's machine learning capabilities, particularly a convolutional neural network (CNN), which I trained on thousands of images. The result was a dashboard that could analyze and return detailed photo outputs. This project not only honed my technical skills but also my ability to create practical, user-centric solutions.

### Simulated Functional Electronic CPU

Another fascinating project was designing a simple functional CPU using [Logisim](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution) simulation software. This CPU, comprised of an Arithmetic Logic Unit & Control Unit, could perform nine instructions, including arithmetic operations and logical shifts. It was a practical application of my learning in computer architecture and electronics, and it pushed me to think both analytically and creatively.

### Package Routing Application

I also developed a Python-based text interface to manage the efficient delivery of over 40 packages using minimal resources. This project required me to implement a self-adjusting data structure and algorithm, ensuring all packages met their delivery deadlines and notes. It was a challenge that combined my knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and practical problem-solving skills.

## Reflections and Looking Forward

As I reflect on my academic journey, I am filled with a sense of accomplishment and excitement for the future. My experience at [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu/) has not only equipped me with a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical aspects of computing but has also ignited a passion for continuous learning and innovation.

My role as an [AI Data Annotator](/blog/what-is-ai-data-annotation/), alongside my academic background, has given me a unique perspective on the real-world applications of AI and data science. I look forward to applying the knowledge and skills I've gained in more advanced roles in the tech industry.

This milestone is not just the end of a chapter but the beginning of a new one. As I continue to juggle professional duties with personal projects, I am eager to embrace future challenges and opportunities, ever committed to making a meaningful impact in the tech world. With a relentless quest for knowledge and a fervor for technological innovation, I am ready to contribute to and grow in this dynamic industry.
