	<h2 class="mb-4 mt-8">My Personal Journey in Tech</h2>
	<p>
		My journey began in the shadow of Silicon Valley, under my grandfather's guidance. A skilled
		machinist, he introduced me to the world of computers at six years old, igniting a lifelong
		passion for technology. I vividly remember the early days of bulky monitors and dial-up
		internet, a stark contrast to the natural beauty of weekends spent fishing and hiking. By eight,
		I had gotten my very own PC, which became my gateway to further explore the realms of software,
		gaming, and digital creativity. My curiosity & fascination with technology has expanded as
		quickly as technology has continued to evolve over the years.
	</p>
	<p>
		My high school years were marked by academic excellence and leadership, culminating in my role
		as Salutatorian and the founding of a STEM club. These experiences honed my leadership skills
		and laid the groundwork for how I would later end up spending my gap year, a crucial period for
		personal growth in my life, which saw me founding a digital marketing agency called Foundry
		Media Company, at nineteen years old.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most notable of these achievements was my recent graduation from university with a Bachelor of
		Science in Computer Science. It was here that I studied advanced topics like Discrete
		Mathematics, Calculus, Software Engineering, AI and Machine Learning, culminating in a AI/ML Web
		App Capstone Project that exemplified my ability to combine technical knowledge with practical
		solutions. My journey has uniquely equipped me for a career in technology, underpinned by a
		profound respect for both the environment and digital innovation's transformative power.
